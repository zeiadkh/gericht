## This is a restaurant website made using [React js, css, react-icons, image-kit.io]

### some notes:
  #### -I have learned to use the great React hook "use ref" (with images gallery, video button)  which do the same main function of "use state" except that doesn't cause rerendering dom.
  #### -image-kit is a wonderful solution to compress any image by converting it to .webp which make a huge difference to your website rendering time.
  #### -I was trying to use "BEM" technique in css class naming I saw its not so easy put it makes your naming system neat.
### It was a good new experience and skills and I looking forward to do so much better react-apps.
